Loop0:`<p>And then, without any warning, I was standing in a large circular room with no memory of how I'd gotten there. The room was divided into... Sixteen sections by glass walls, and in each section was a copy of me. Male, short blonde hair, plain dark clothing covering everything but the hands and the head.</p>

<p>Almost all of them had already begun departing, the stone wall behind their section sliding out of the way. The one immediately to my left smirked and pointed to the wall behind me before leaving me alone in the room.</p>

<p>As soon as I stepped toward the wall a blue screen appeared hovering in front of me.</p>

<div class="bluescreen"><p>Who are you, Dann? Who will you be? What is more natural to you? Choose, but know that the choice is not final. You will choose again.</p>

<p>Do you want to start with Intuition, focusing on theories and what might be happening?</p>

<p>Or would you prefer Sensing, focusing on what is happening around you?</p>

<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XSXX");' class="choice">Sensing</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNXX");' class="choice">Intuition</a></div></div>`,
Loop1:`And then I was back in the starting room again. I took a deep breath, suppressing a sob, my emotions catching up with me now that I had a moment. A few more deep breaths and I was feeling more stable.

Most of the copies of me that I could see were already leaving the room, only the one immediately to my right not moving. He was looking around with a dopey stunned look on his face that struck me as funny.

Damn, I had been completely clueless. I pointed to the wall behind him and then turned to the wall behind me, triggering the blue screen.

The choice I made before was now yellow which I somehow just knew meant that the path was partially complete, it would start the same but with different choices that would lead to new experiences.

<div class="bluescreen"><p>And so you come back to the first choice. Choose and explore who you could be.</p>

<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XSXX");' class="choice">Sensing</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNXX");' class="choice">Intuition</a></div></div>`,
Loop2:`<p>And back to this room. I step back to trigger the blue screen. As soon as I choose one of the two choices I seem to fully immerse into the experience, half forgetting that I start in a room of copies of myself.</p>
<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XSXX");' class="choice">Sensing</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNXX");' class="choice">Intuition</a></div></div>`,
Loop3:`<p>Here I am again. What is this place? Who am I? What am I doing here? The choice is the only thing there is from this room, everyone just leaving without even trying to communicate.</p>
<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XSXX");' class="choice">Sensing</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNXX");' class="choice">Intuition</a></div></div>`,
Loop4:`<p>A wave of emotion crashes down around me. I trigger the choice and just stare at it. I know that once I make the choice yet again my turmoil will fall away as the experience takes over.</p>
<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XSXX");' class="choice">Sensing</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNXX");' class="choice">Intuition</a></div></div>`,
Loop5:`<p>Why are the loops so short... I need more time in them, I want them to be longer, to give me a life to live. Living the next experience, the next personality, is all that I have. And maybe reliving one of the better ones.</p>

Loop6:`<p>Wait, I should have thought about this before. Two choices, four times. There are only sixteen possible loops.</p>

Loop8:`<p>The simulations are so different from each other, but the pieces I've experienced before and am going through again are always identical, down to how I feel and what I think in them. It's only in this room with the other copies of me, in the between space, that my thoughts are free and my own.</p>
<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XSXX");' class="choice">Sensing</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNXX");' class="choice">Intuition</a></div></div>`,
Loop9:`<p>I am learning a lot about who the different personality types are, though I can't help but think different ones would react differently, and maybe better, to experiences that other personalities got to have.</p>
<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XSXX");' class="choice">Sensing</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNXX");' class="choice">Intuition</a></div></div>`,
Loop10:`<p>I wonder if I've already lived through the one that suited me the best... I probably did that first, didn't I.</p>
<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XSXX");' class="choice">Sensing</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNXX");' class="choice">Intuition</a></div></div>`,
Loop11:`<p>Five more simulations to go. Do I just stop existing when the loops run out? When the blue screens appear the people in the world freeze, will that be me? Just stuck in a moment not knowing that time is passing outside. I have to escape.</p>
<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XSXX");' class="choice">Sensing</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNXX");' class="choice">Intuition</a></div></div>`,
Loop12:`<p>Of course I can't escape from within a loop, they play out exactly each time with nothing changing.</p>
<p>Maybe if I choose a greyed-out loop... Wait, didn't I just do that? And now I'm back here thinking the same thing as I did before trying it. Are my thoughts not free even outside of the loops?</p>
<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XSXX");' class="choice">Sensing</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNXX");' class="choice">Intuition</a></div></div>`,
Loop13:`<p>I'm just going to wait and let time pass without triggering the choice.</p>
<p>I sat with my back against one of the glass walls.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I thought was going to happen. Why wouldn't the simulation be able to wait me out.</p>
<p>I could go crazy just sitting here.</p>
<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XSXX");' class="choice">Sensing</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNXX");' class="choice">Intuition</a></div></div>`,
Loop14:`<p>Almost done. Two more. Nothing I do matters, but I don't feel like this within the loops.</p>

<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XSXX");' class="choice">Sensing</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNXX");' class="choice">Intuition</a></div></div>`,
Loop16:`<div class="bluescreen"><p>Congratulations! You have completed the <em>Artificial Intelligence Personality Training</em> simulation. You are now qualified to choose your personality which will make up the core of your identity.</p>

<p>I dismissed the screen with a thought. The next room was large, with four tables filling most of the room with enough space to walk around and in between them. One person was standing along each of the walls, a man on my left and a woman across from me and to my right. They were wearing similar clothing to mine but in unique colours.

<p>There were no exits to the room, and a glance behind me showed that the stone wall that I had entered through had closed without me noticing.

<p>I headed down the gap between the tables to the centre of the room and the other three did the same. Just as I got there another blue screen appeared and from what I could see around it everyone else had paused mid-step.

<div class="bluescreen">Another choice. What is more important to you: Feeling/empathy or Thinking/rationality?

<div class="choiceContainer"><a href='javascript:goTo("XNFX");' class="choice">Feeling</a><a href='javascript:goTo("XNTX")' class="choice">Thinking</a></div></div>`,
XNFX:`<p class="bluescreen">Intuitive Feeling (XNFX). The Idealist, Diplomatic. Harmony is more important than objective truth. Decisions are made with the heart more than the head. Teamwork is the answer. Solve the puzzle.</p>

<p>I dismissed the screen and everything started moving again.</p>

<p>"Hello," I said as the others arrived. "Let's work together to get this solved."</p>

<p>The man who came from the left grunted. He was taller than me, solidly built, and with chiselled features twisted into a scowl.</p>

<p>"The last room we were in failed because of one of them," he said. "They aren't worth working with."</p>

<p>He pointed to the woman who came from the opposite side of the room from him. She was wearing lighter-coloured clothing and clutching a pendant in her hands.</p>

<p>I was about to ask what he was talking about when another blue screen popped up, interrupting and freezing the world again.</p>

<div class="bluescreen"><p>Do you make Intuitive leaps that you share with others, seeking internal harmony of your actions with your values (Perceiving)?</p>

<p>Or is your Intuition about your inner world, your thoughts and ideas, and you seek external harmony between people (Judging)?</p>

<div class="choiceContainer"><a class="choice" href="javascript:goTo('XNFP');">Perceiving</a><a class="choice" href="javascript:goTo('XNFJ');">Judging</a></div></div>`,
XNTX:`<p class="bluescreen">Intuitive Thinking (XNTX). Rational, Strategic. What is objectively true is more important than how people feel. Decisions are made with the head more than the heart. Solving the problem is the answer.</p>

<p>I tried to move with the screen still up but even though I didn't feel restrained nothing happened. Dismissing the screen unfroze everything. That could be useful if I ever needed time to think.</p>

<p>The woman from the right, who was clutching a large ankh, was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Another room, and more faithless strangers," she said. "May my journey reach a destination soon."</p>

<p>"You've done this before?" the man asked. "What is this place?"</p>

<p>"The place in between places," she said. "Where we are tested before being allowed to move on."</p>

<p>I was about to interject when another blue screen appeared in front of me.</p>

<div class="bluescreen"><p>Do you make Intuitive leaps that you share with others, building an internal framework of reality (Perceiving)?</p>

<p>Or is your Intuition about your inner world, your thoughts and ideas, and you seek to understand the laws and rules in the external world (Judging)?</p>

XNFJ:`<p class="bluescreen">Extroverted Feeling, Introverted Intuition (XNFJ). The Mentor, Developing. Warm, caring, and considerate. Everyone getting along is the most important thing.</p>

<p>I dismissed the screen and stepped in front of the man, raising my hands to calm them.</p>

<p>"Peace, friend," I said. "Everyone is different and deserves to be given a chance. This person..."</p>

<p>I gestured to the woman.</p>

<p>"Helen," she said in a small mousey voice.</p>

<p>"Helen," I continued. "She wasn't the one who let you down in the past, right?"</p>

<p>"She wasn't," the man said. "But that symbol means she's a Systemist. They can get it into their head to betray you for no reason."</p>

<p>"He isn't wrong," Helen said. "The System is all, and we are directed by it. He went against it and was marked for his transgression."</p>

<p>"You Bi-", the man said.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that wasn't very helpful for the situation," I said, cutting him off. "Teamwork is-"</p>

<p>A blue screen cut me off.</p>

<div class="bluescreen"><p>Do you judge before knowing everything about a situation (Extroverted)?</p>

<p>Or do you see problems that no one else seems to (Introverted)?</p>

XNFP:`<p class="bluescreen">Extroverted Intuition, Introverted Feeling (XNFP). The Advocate, Mediating. Ethical, open-minded, moral. Honouring your core beliefs is the most important thing.</p>

<p>A look of fear was frozen on the pendant woman's face. The other woman in darker clothing was stepping back, she didn't look like she was going to take a side.</p>

<p>The man easily outweighed me and it was all muscle. Not someone I had much of a chance of beating in a fight.</p>

<p>I dismissed the blue screen.</p>

<p>"What is your problem?" I asked the man.</p>

<p>"I already told you," the man said, stepping forward with his huge fists clenched. "They start spouting religious nonsense and then the next thing you know they've sabotaged the room. I'm going to enjoy taking them out of the equation."</p>

<p>"Nope," I said, stepping forward. "Not going to happen."</p>

<p>The other woman was frowning in disgust. The woman with the pendant was cowering behind me.</p>

<p>A blue screen appeared before the man decided what he was going to do.</p>

<div class="bluescreen"><p>Do you jump into new projects before retreating to process them emotionally (Extroverted)?</p>

<p>Or do you first need to feel strongly about a project before starting it (Introverted)?</p>

<p>I let the freeze of the blue screen give me time to think. There was something deeper at play here, and I think I saw what it was. I dismissed the blue screen.</p>

<p>"- what the System wants for us to succeed at this room," I continued. "You... Guy?..."</p>

<p>"Joshua," the man said.</p>

<p>"Joshua," I said. "The System put you here to have you fail again because of your prejudice against Systemists. And this time it will be your fault that you fail.</p>

<p>"And you, Helen, the System said to solve the problem," I continued. "But it said that teamwork is the answer; we are the problem."</p>

<p>"You can see the system?" Helen asked.</p>

<p>"Yes?" I said. "Blue screens appear and the world stops for me to make a choice."</p>

<p>"It's you," Helen said. "This is all for you. And you wish for us to work together. Very well. I apologise Joshua."</p>

<p>Joshua nodded, looking shocked.</p>

<p>"- the answer to this room," I said, dismissing the screen immediately. "Surely we're all intelligent enough that we can work together long enough to succeed? Helen, you take this table."</p>

<p>I looked at the man and turned my palm up to him.</p>

<p>"Jonathan," he said.</p>

<p>"Jonathan," I said. "You take that one. That leaves this one here for me, Dann, and the last for..."</p>

<p>"Lucy," the other woman said.</p>

<p>"Lucy," I said. "Call out what you find."</p>

<p>"I have four buttons on my table," Lucy said.</p>

<p>"Same here," Jonathan said, quickly followed by Helen.</p>

<p>Mine had the same, symbols on all four, though only one that I recognised - the Systemist symbol.</p>

<p>"I know what three of these are," Lucy said. "We each take the tables that match our symbols. Helen is at hers already. Jonathan has the death symbol, that's mine. Dann is Anti-Systemist, that's Jonathan's. And mine is 'Artificial', which must be Dann's."</p>

<p>We all swapped to the tables Lucy pointed out and the world froze.</p>

INFP:`<p class="bluescreen">INFP. The Healer, Conciliating. You lead with Introverted Feeling, prioritising what is important to you. You are a great listener and protect the feelings of those close to you.</p>

<p>I wasn't going to let a man beat up a defenseless woman, I don't care what his reasons are. I'm not going to stand aside just because I can't win.</p>

<p>I dismissed the blue screen put up my fists ready to fight.</p>

<p>The man grunted again.</p>

<p>"What even is the clear condition of this room," he said. "Oh well, I'll figure it out after going through you."</p>

<p>"Teamwork is the answer," I said. "Teamwork against you."</p>

<p>He swung his fist at my chin and I wasn't able to get out of the way. The next thing I knew the pendant woman was helping me up off the ground.</p>

<p>The other woman was punching the man in the side with short vicious punches. There was a crack of his ribs breaking, then he backhanded her and sent her flying onto one of the tables.</p>

<p>I charged him and threw my shoulder into his broken ribs.</p>

<p>His neck hit the edge of the table with a crack and he fell and didn't get back up.</p>

ENFP:`<p class="bluescreen">ENFP. The Champion, Motivating. You lead with Extroverted Intuition, acting to try new things. You help those in need and show appreciation for people.</p>

<p>I dismissed the blue screen and immediately after there was a sharp stabbing pain in my back.</p>

<p>I turned, knocking the woman with the pendant back.</p>

<p>The lower third of the pendant, about the length of my thumb, was a blade covered in my blood. She'd stabbed me.</p>

<p>"I told you," the man said. "Get up on the table out of her range. You, other lady, help him."</p>

<p>I went to reply and coughed up blood instead. My back still in searing pain I rolled up onto the table furtherst from the maniac with the blade.</p>

<p>The other woman climbed onto one of the tables closest to her and then jumped over to mine.</p>

<p>My vision was fading when a wave of ice flooded into my wound and the pain vanished.</p>

<p>I gasped and then reflexively coughed, but the blood in my lungs was gone too.</p>

<p>The woman with the pendant was laying on the ground with her neck bent the wrong way. The man had gashes in his arms that were closing under the glowing hands of the other woman.</p>

<p>"Thank you, both," I said.</p>

<p>I was about to ask about the magical healing when the world froze with the loop ending.</p>

XNTJ:`<p class="bluescreen">Extroverted Thinking, Introverted Intuition (XNTJ). The Coordinator, Arranging. Intense, efficient, competent. Having a plan is the most important thing.</p>

<p>I dismissed the blue screen.</p>

<p>"So you all see the blue screens too?" I asked.</p>

<p>The woman with the ankh snapped her head around to look at me.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "There is only one person in here with direct System access. All other Systemists use their pendants to get vague impressions of the System's intent."</p>

<p>She held up her ankh.</p>

<p>"What has the System told you?" the other woman asked.</p>

<p>"Uh..." I said. "Nothing that seems relevant to the room. 'Solving the problem is the answer.'"</p>

<p>There was a flicker on the tables each of which now had posters on them that weren't there before.</p>

<p>"That looks like what we need to be focusing on," I said, glad of the distraction.</p>

<p>The world froze with a blue screen.</p>

<div class="bluescreen"><p>Do you want to lead the group, making sure everyone is working to solve the problem (Extroverted)?</p>

<p>"Tested," I said. "What sort of tests have you seen?"</p>

<p>"Many," she said. "The System can set people against each other in fights, or have the only way to exit the room be a puzzle that requires all of the people added to solve."</p>

<p>"And how do we tell what sort of room this is?" I asked.</p>

<p>The tables around us lit up. Two in opposite corners filled with mazes rising from their surfaces. The other two tables were suddenly holding rows of small mirrors on stands. A beam of light started in the centre of the maze nearest to me.</p>

<p>"So," I said. "It's a puzzle room. Mirrors to redirect the light beam around the maze. The other centre is dark, so that is the destination."</p>

<p>Before anyone could respond another blue screen was in front of me.</p>

<p>With the world frozen I had the time to assess two of the four posters, having turned my head to look at them as they appeared. Both of them had stylistic renditions of a fight on them. One versus three and two versus two.</p>

<p>I dismissed the blue screen and turned to look at the other two posters. Everyone against each other and four against a question mark.</p>

<p>"It's a fight, then," I said. "And we get to pick how it plays out. Form up in the centre, facing outwards."</p>

<p>I picked up the poster for the four of us against something else.</p>

<p>It disolved in flame as the four tables sank into the floor.</p>

<p>"Whatever comes, he and I will distract it," I said. "Systemist lady, you support the lady with the dagger, who will be the one killing it."</p>

<p>"What- I don't-," dagger lady said. "How did you know?"</p>

<p>The ground rumbled as the wall behind me split open, followed by a deafening bellow.</p>

<p>And then the world froze with a blue screen before the fight even began. How was that 'solving the problem'?</p>

INTJ:`<p class="bluescreen">INTJ. The Mastermind, Devising. You lead with Introverted Intuition, you know how to fit things together to end up at the result you want.</p>

<p>The woman without the ankh had a weapon, and was considering using it on me. The Systemist woman with something between envy and worship, she would fight on my behalf. And the man didn't know what was going on, completely emotionally off-balance. He would be against whoever attacked first. A weapon would be useful.</p>

<p>The poster nearest me depicted a free-for-all fight, the further one a three versus one fight.</p>

<p>I dismissed the blue screen, leaned over and touched the free-for-all poster.</p>

<p>All of the posters disappeared in a flash of flame and the tables followed immediately after, a wave of heat rolling off of them.</p>

<p>"The System just told me that she was going to stab one of us in the back," I said, pointing at the woman who had the concealed weapon.</p>

<p>"You lie!" she said, pulling out a dagger that was the length of her arm and lunging at me.</p>

<p>With the tables gone I easily stepped back and slightly behind the Systemist woman, who stepped forward. And got stabbed in the throat.</p>

<p>The man punched the woman in the side of the head making her fall down, leaving the dagger behind.</p>

<p>I stepped forward, tore the dagger from the Systemist's throat and plunged it into the man's heart.</p>

<p>"Everyone grab some mirrors and let's get started," I said, moving to do exactly that myself.</p>

<p>I placed the first mirror to redirect the beam of light out into the maze, then a second one to turn it down another corridor.</p>

<p>"So, has anyone done any mazes?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Uh, I have," the other woman said in a soft voice.</p>

<p>"Speak up, then," I said. "We're trying to get to that corner."</p>

<p>I pointed to the far corner, the one in the opposite direction to the other maze. That corner was raised and would allow a mirror to redirect the light beam over the walls of the maze and to the maze on the other table.</p>

<p>With the quiet woman, whose name I never did ask, mapping a path and the other three of us placing mirrors we were done with the first maze in minutes. And the second one took about the same amount of time.</p>

<p>I kept expecting a complication to arrive, but the blue screen announcing the success of the loop came as soon as the light beam hit the centre.</p>

<p>The obvious solution was to painstakingly lead the light beam around the maze to the high point where it could be sent to the other maze and then the process repeated there.</p>

<p>But there was a better, much easier, option.</p>

<p>I dismissed the blue screen and picked up a stack of mirrors. The others did the same, starting at the light beam, so I went to the destination. It didn't matter which side I started at.</p>

<p>The center of the maze was in a dip, the walls there about twice the height of the mirrors on their stands. Laying one of the mirrors on its side at the inner wall of the destination I angled it so that it reflected the ceiling to the dark orb in the middle. Then I balanced one mirror on the maze wall above it, using two other mirrors and their stands to angle it perfectly toward the center of the other maze.</p>

<p>It had taken me about five minutes to finish that, and the others were about halfway done with the first maze.</p>

<p>On going to pick up more mirrors to repeat my strategy at the light beam I realised I only needed two more. We could have been done in seconds if I'd thought to ask one of them to hold two of the mirrors. Oh well.</p>

<p>Holding the two mirrors, one in each hand, I bounced the light up out of the first maze and reflected it to the second maze.</p>

<p>I dismissed the screen and was suddenly in a field of knee-high green grass outside, a pine tree forest surrounding it some distance away. The air was clear and fresh with just a hint of early spring bite to it, the sun warm on my hands and face. Insect and bird noises drifted on the breeze, as well as the sound of a stream somewhere nearby.</p>

<p>The stone doorway that I had come through, that I expected to see behind me, wasn't there. A blue screen interrupted my inspection of the nearer treeline behind me.</p>

<div class="bluescreen"><p>But will you be someone who focuses more on their external senses - what they can see, hear, touch, smell and taste (Extroverted Sensing)</p>

<p>A rush of memories flooded into my mind and I would have fallen if the frozen world of the blue screen wasn't holding me in place.</p>

<p>I dismissed the blue screen so that I could sink to my knees in the grass and hold my head that was radiating pain with a red heat.</p>

<p>I could feel a new inner sense, like drinking a glass of water after being in a desert. My new memories guided me as though I'd done it thousands of times before, and with a flex of my will a healing spell sank into my brain. The burning fire of the pain snuffed out like a candle.</p>

<p>I revelled in the relief even as a new blue screen froze the world again.</p>

<p>When I dismissed the blue screen and turned back around there were two groups of people emerging from opposite sides of the glade. Leather armour and short spears made up the majority of equipment of both groups. The ones from the left had strictly matching equipment, an organised military force, where the ones from the right were more irregular and individualistic, some of which were obviously higher quality even at this distance.</p>

<p>How they organised themselves matched their presentation, the unified group lining up in neat lines while the other group clumped up in a mob that grew into the glade.</p>

<p>I started to back toward the closest treeline and a shout went up from both sides that was cut off by another blue screen appearing.</p>

<p>I wasn't supposed to be here. This wasn't what I was supposed to be doing. There was something... More. Something next, maybe?</p>

<p>The memories that I had been given felt natural, but they were obviously artificial. They lacked detail or any sense of history. They didn't give me any sense of the rules, which was impossible if they were memories I had made. They let me understand my magic, but that was about all.</p>

<p>Dismissing the screen, I could feel the magic energy inside myself, like a metaphysical extra pair of lungs. As I paid more attention to it there was a noticeable tether leading... Back... Somewhere. My memories showed me how to activate the spell that would return me, but not what I would be returning to. With the field I was in not having any answers I set about building the spellform with my will.</p>

<p>The spell reached its peak and activated as a blue screen appeared, freezing the world in the moment of travel.</p>

<p>I dismissed the blue screen and dug my fingers into the rich loamy earth below me. This was good, I was at peace in the place of my forefathers. I could feel them watching over me, giving me guidance.</p>

<p>I got to my feet, dusting off my hands. Slow measured steps, the same my father and his father before him had taken, took me to the stream flowing along the edge of the glade.</p>

<p>A set of steps led down into the depths of the stream, worn in the centre from the tread of generations. I followed them down, the chill water rising until it was up to my neck. With a deep breath I stepped forward off the steps and into the depths of the stream. Before I sank more than another step down a blue screen appeared to me.</p>

<p>Waving away the blue screen I reversed my retreat and headed toward the centre of the field. One person from both groups came out to meet me, an officer and one of the better-equipped individuals who was wielding a giant sword.</p>

<p>They both stopped at an equal distance from me and each other, just close enough for us not to have to shout.</p>

<p>"Lovely weather for it," I said.</p>

<p>"What?" the officer asked, while the swordsman grinned.</p>

<p>"You lot look like you're sizing up for a battle," I said. "It's good weather for it. Just a little bit chill, no clouds or rain, and the ground is firm and dry."</p>

<p>I dismissed the screen and continued backing away. The shouting continued, each side riling themselves up for the coming fight.</p>

<p>I made it to the trees without either side paying attention to me. The smell of pine strong in my nose and the wind more chill now that I was out of the sun.</p>

<p>The shouting quieted down as one person from each side headed toward the centre. In the silence I could hear movement in the forest behind me from both directions.</p>

<p>The trees were too thick to see very far but I caught a flash of motion alarmingly close and dropped to the ground as an arrow thunked into the tree I'd been standing next to, just barely missing.</p>

<p>I rolled around to the far side of the tree and a blue screen appeared.</p>

<p>I could see both my origin and my destination with perfect clarity at the same time. The impossibility of it was giving me a headache. Dismissing the blue screen snapped me to my destination.</p>

<p>"Welcome back, Dann," a man in garish red robes in front of me said. "Obviously no memory issues, as you were able to return. Did it work?"</p>

<p>I had no idea who this person was. But they'd given me enough context to give a report.</p>

<p>"Almost complete memory loss, actually," I said. "I have memories of how to spellcast, but that is about it."</p>

<p>I must have teleported back to the middle floors of an enormous building from the number of people I could see around, above, and below me.</p>

<p>I dismissed the screen and there was a tug from the core of my magic, pulling me inwards.</p>

<p>The pressure from the spell built inside me, matching the pressure as I sank into the depths of the stream.</p>

<p>With a twitch of my will, I accepted the summoning spell with a pop.</p>

<p>I was standing on top of an altar in a candle-lit stone room, with six people surrounding the altar in dark hooded robes.</p>

<p>Very sinister. But these were my people.</p>

<p>"It worked," one of them said quietly.</p>

<p>"Shh," another said. "We greet the honoured ancestor. We have need of your wisdom, and strength."</p>

<p>I couldn't breathe in the frozen world, my lungs locked in place.</p>

<p>I dismissed the blue screen, and then couldn't breathe because I was deep underwater.</p>

<p>My breath left me in an explosion of bubbles. And then there was air around me, and a spectral blue form in front of me.</p>

<p>"Be at peace child of my line," she said. "You are here to learn who you could be."</p>

<p>"No," I said. "I got here by accident."</p>

<p>"No you didn't," the military man said. "You are coming back with us to answer for your crimes."</p>

<p>He pulled out a pair of restraints and walked towards me, the swordsman walking forward as well.</p>

<p>When they were within fighting range the swordsman stopped and threw me a smaller sword from his back.</p>

<p>I caught it and swept it from its scabbard, making the blade dance in a complicated pattern that included slicing through the restraints the military man was holding. I ended with the point of the blade pointing at his throat.</p>

<p>"It is a great day for it," the swordsman said. "I can lend you a sword if you wanted to join in?"</p>

<p>"What madness is this?" the military man asked. "We're here to discuss the terms of your surrender."</p>

<p>"Nah," the swordsman said. "I like our chances. So how about it, guy, want to join our side?"</p>

<p>Of the two sides, the military one didn't appeal to me at all. Highly structured, being told what to do, blindly following orders to fight.</p>

<p>"Peace, friend," I said. "I'm not with them."</p>

<p>"You're not with us, either," the archer said, an arrow pointed at me. "In this place, at this time, that makes you an enemy."</p>

<p>"Nope, I'm a friend," I said with a grin.</p>

<p>There was a flicker of motion to the right.</p>

<p>"Look out," I said, pointing that way.</p>

<p>He reacted impressively fast, turning and firing without seeming to aim. An arrow glanced off the tree next to him and disappeared into the forest and a man in the military armour fell down with an arrow in his heart.</p>

<p>I dismissed the screen and pushed against the tree to change my direction, the rough bark scraping my palms.</p>

<p>The arrow stuck up from the dirt where I would have been. The tear in the left shoulder of my shirt, and the deep scratch below it, showed how close it had come.</p>

<p>"Wait!" I shouted, raising my empty hands. "I'm unarmed, you wouldn't shoot someone who was unarmed and here by accident, would you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would," came from the direction of the first arrow.</p>

<p>I clenched my eyes tight as the pfft sound of another arrow firing came to me.</p>
