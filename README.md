# Hyperfiction

A hyperfiction written for Curtin University's Creative Writing Supervised Project (CWG340), SP3 2022.

It focuses on Story Structure and the MBTI personality framework for characterisation.

There were some pretty severe limitations to the storytelling due to the total permissible wordcount being 6,600 words. The story had to be relatively static, and each "path" is a 600 word micro-story.
